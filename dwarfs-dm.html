										Fraction of the Universe large-scale structure known as the cosmic web,

										<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.tng-project.org">TNG Collaboration</a>.
										Our main cosmological models predict that dark matter composes about 85%
										of all the mass in the Universe. Most galaxeis are thus believed to be
										embedded in a large and massive dark matter halo of their own.

										The Universe harbors a profound puzzle: the vast majority of its matter is
										invisible, known as dark matter. Despite its elusive nature, evidence
										suggests that dark matter is some sort of binding component that holds
										galaxies together, yet it defies direct detection, challenging our
										understanding of the physical world. Dwarf galaxies, orbiting the Milky
										Way, offer a unique window into this dark universe, as large dark matter
										reservoirs. Their stars move under the influence of dark matter's
										gravitational pull, providing clues about its distribution and properties.
										
										<br><br>Thus, a large observational effort has been invested in obtaining
										line-of-sight (LOS) velocities of these dwarf galaxies, but results from
										analyzing these data have been inconclusive about some predictions from
										our best current cosmological theories. A conspicuous example of this is 
										the so-called “core-cusp problem”: the tension around the predicted and
										observed dark matter mass-density profiles of galaxies. Dark matter
										halos in collisionless cosmological N-body simulations follow a nearly
										universal mass-density profile that increases and diverges toward
										the center,  forming a ‘cusp’. In contrast, observations of some
										dwarfs favor shallower density profile slopes, consistent with a
										constant density ‘core’ at the center.

										<!--span class="image right"-->
										<p>
										Significant uncertainties are introduced by the fact  that most
										observational studies are based solely on LOS velocity measurements,
										which constrain only one component of motion.
										When only LOS velocities are used, there is a strong degeneracy between the mass
										density profile and the velocity anisotropy profile, which quantifies
										differences in velocity dispersions in orthogonal directions. Some models
										mitigate this degeneracy by restricting parameter space or using higher-order
										moments, but having only the LOS component of motion fundamentally
										limits what can be achieved.

										<br><br>The key to progress is to measure the internal proper motion (PM) kinematics of
										stars, or in other words, their transverse motion in the plane-of-sky.
										The radial and tangential PM components directly measure the projected
										velocity dispersion anisotropy. This makes PMs crucial for dynamical modeling,
										with models making use of PMs performing consistently better than those
										based solely on LOS velocities.
										However, measuring PMs require long time baselines and exquisite telescope
										precision, which hardly come together and are hard to obtain.

										Given the hard work required to measure PMs, the
										<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.stsci.edu/~marel/hstpromo.html">HSTPROMO Collaboration</a> 
										has inversted a significant amount of team effort to monitor stellar systems
										for many years, and thus aqcuire the necessary data for PM studies of dwarf galaxies
										(see animation above).
										With this data, we were able to measure, for the first time, the 3D velocity
										dispersion profile of a dwarf galaxy, with data uncertainties smaller than
										dispersion itself.
										This allowed us to constrain the dark matter slope in the Draco dwarf galaxy to
										a cusp with enough confidence to give more credence to current cosmological models,
										such as 
										<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda-CDM_model">&Lambda;CDM</a>.
