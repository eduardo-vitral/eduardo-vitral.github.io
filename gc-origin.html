										One of the biggest mysteries still unsolved in astrophysics is: 
										How did globular clusters (GCs) form? These roughly spherical collections 
										of stars tightly bound by gravity are of typical ages as old as (>)10 Gyrs, 
										which means that they were formed around the same time as the galaxies they orbit. 
										Only recently have we attained a high enough computational resolution, given 
										their small scales compared to their host galaxies, to start answering 
										this question. However, a reliable picture of their formation is yet not 
										completely clear, and different formation scenarios could coexist.
										
										<br><br>For instance, one proposed mechanism is that they could be formed 
										in their own dark matter (DM) minihalos, such as galaxies, but due to 
										lack of observational constraints and poor data in the outskirts of GCs 
										(where possible amounts of DM may still exist), this scenario remains 
										considerably unexplored. Other possible formation scenarios include GCs as
										relics of young massive clusters formed in the high-redshift Universe, or being
										debris of past galaxy mergers or being simply formed in-situ along with their host. 
										All these possibilities have arguments in favor and against them, with particular 
										GCs being more or less likely to cope with the predictions of each scenario. 
										Therefore, it is more arguable that these star clusters probably arose 
										from more than a single formation channel.

										I have explored the formation scenario where GCs are formed inside 
										their own DM mini-halos with the help of numerical N-body simulations performed by my collaborator,

     									The extension of bound GC stars and bound DM particles are highlighted as dotted

     									from blue (lower dispersion) to red (higher dispersion). The centers of Fornax 
     									and of the GC are represented as a thick green cross and a plus sign, respectively. 
     									For this cluster, we notice that the empirical tidal radius, well traced by

                                        <br>This is because the dark extra mass triggers a tidal radius growth that allows 
                                        the mini-halo to act as a protective shield against tidal stripping, being itself 
                                        stripped beforehand the stars. As a consequence, tidal effects such as inflation of 
                                        the stellar velocity dispersion, development of prominent tidal tails, ellipticity increase 
                                        and diffusion of the stellar distribution profile are generally much milder in clusters 
                                        that are embedded in DM.
