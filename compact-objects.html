										Globular clusters (GCs) are some of the most 
										dynamically active environments in the Universe. 
										These spherical, dense clusters contain stars that 
										are tightly packed, with the densest GCs having 
										inner densities up to a million times greater than 
										our solar neighborhood. In these environments, 
										stellar evolution is influenced by internal dynamics, 
										leading to phenomena like runaway mergers and mass 
										segregation. This process pushes more massive stars 
										closer to the center while less massive stars 
										drift outward. As a result, GCs serve as excellent 
										laboratories for studying compact objects such as 
										white dwarfs, neutron stars, stellar-mass black 
										holes, and intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs).

										Two key questions in these dense systems are: “How is mass 
										distributed?” and “What types of stars or compact objects 
										contribute to the cluster’s mass at various radii?” 
										Studies suggest that excess mass in GCs may hint at 
										the presence of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs), 
										a long-sought missing link in black hole physics. 
										To explore these questions, I employ the Jeans equation 
										and the MAMPOSSt-PM modeling code to constrain the mass 
										and velocity anisotropy profiles of GCs:
										$$\frac{{\rm d}\left (\rho\sigma_r^2\right)}{{\rm d}r} + 2\,\frac{\beta(r)}{
										r}\,\rho(r)\sigma_r^2(r) = -\rho(r) \frac{G\,M(r)}{r^2} \ .$$
										However, the Jeans equation alone cannot determine the 
										stellar composition of the mass profile. To assess whether 
										the measured mass consists of luminous stars, black holes, 
										white dwarfs, or neutron stars, we require additional tools. 
										Together with my collaborators, we utilize evolutionary 
										Monte Carlo simulations from the 
										<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" 
										href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4365/ab7919">CMC catalog</a>, 
										matched to Milky Way clusters. By identifying good matches, 
										we can fully constrain the shape and composition of the 
										mass profile in the analyzed GC.

										<h4><font size="+0">The role of core-collapse</font></h4>
										One of the most interesting phenomena related to GCs is the process 
										of core-collapse, which is intrinsically related to the exchange of
                                        energy due to dynamical interactions in the cluster. In self-gravitating
                                        systems like GCs, the virial theorem reveals that the centers of GCs
                                        have a negative heat capacity, i.e. an energy input in the system
                                        triggers a decrease of the kinetic energy, which can be regarded as
                                        the system’s ‘temperature’. Such a counterintuitive relation tends 
                                        to evolve in a typical cluster’s interior,
                                        as it exchanges energy with its outer regions, naturally from the
                                        former to the latter. This process leads inevitably to the ‘collapse’ of
                                        stars to the cluster’s inner-most regions. 
                                        
                                        <br><br>Many works argue that core-collapse can be halted due to
                                        a process called <em>binary burning</em>, where dynamical interactions 
                                        of binaries with other stars cause tight (‘hard’) binaries to harden while the
                                        third star (not necessarily the original one) is kicked out at a higher
                                        speed than the initial third star came in with. This
                                        process effectively pumps energy to the cluster’s inner regions, thus
                                        preventing core-collapse from continuing indefinitely.
                                                                                
										<br><br>Black holes in GCs form and sink early (on roughly 100 Myr time-scales)
                                        to the cluster’s center due to a combination of their high masses
                                        and energy equipartition. Once in the inner regions of GCs, black
                                        holes dynamically interact with one another and with luminous stars.
                                        Those living in hard binaries thus provide a similar energy exchange
                                        towards the cluster’s interior as in the classical stellar binary-burning
                                        scenario, but amplified due to the relative high masses of black holes
                                        compared to stars. This new theoretical comprehension of the physics governing
                                        GCs suggests that the ones without the characteristic inner cuspy
                                        structure of core-collapse probably harbour a segregated black hole
                                        population, responsible for the delay of core-collapse. This phenomenon has 
                                        been referred to as <em>black hole binary burning</em>.

										the closest of its kind to our Sun. For the first time, we fitted its 3D velocity anisotropy profile
										and showed it to be isotropic at the center, while tangential at the outskirts.

										and robustly fit the central mass profile of this cluster. We measured a dark central
										mass of roughly 800 ± 300 M<sub>⊙</sub> , but it was not possible to distinguish between a point-like
