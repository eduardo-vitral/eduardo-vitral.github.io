										</span>Globular clusters (GCs) are among the most dynamically active
										environments in the Universe. These roughly spherical, dense 
										clusters are composed of stars tightly packed, with the densest GCs
										having inner densities as much as a million times greater than 
										what is observed in our solar neighborhood. In such dense environments, 
										stellar evolution is shaped by the internal dynamics by means of 
										phenomena such as runaway mergers, as well as mass segregation: a 
										consequence of dynamical friction and energy equipartition that leads 
										more massive stars to locate closer to the cluster’s center, while less 
										massive ones are moved towards the outskirts. This makes GCs excellent 
										laboratories to study compact objects – including white dwarfs, neutron 
										stars, stellar-mass black holes, and intermediate-mass  black holes (IMBHs).

										Two important questions that arise in such dense systems are 
										“How is their mass distributed?” and “Which type of stars 
										(or compact objects) compose the bulk of the cluster’s mass at different radii?”. 
										In addition, many works have suggested that inner mass excesses in GCs could 
										indicate the presence of IMBHs, a long sought missing link of black hole physics.
										In order to address those questions, I use the Jeans equation 
										(in particular, the MAMPOSSt-PM modeling code) to constrain 
										the the shape of the GC mass and velocity anisotropy profiles:
										$$\frac{{\rm d}\left (\rho\sigma_r^2\right)}{{\rm d}r} + 2\,\frac{\beta(r)}{
                                        r}\,\rho(r)\sigma_r^2(r) = -\rho(r) \frac{G\,M(r)}{r^2} \ .$$
                                        The Jeans equation does not necessarily tell, however, the stellar composition 
                                        of the mass profile. In other words, to evaluate if the measured mass is 
                                        composed of luminous stars, black holes, white dwarfs or neutron stars, we 
                                        require other tools. Hence, with my collaborators, we use evolutionary 
                                        Monte Carlo numerical simulations of GCs from the 
                                        <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4365/ab7919">CMC catalog</a>, 
                                        matched to the Milky Way clusters. By finding good matches, we are able to 
                                        fully constrain the shape and composition of the mass profile of the analyzed GC. 
                                        
                                        <br><br> <b><em>One of the important results of my work was to show that the 
                                        inner mass excess in some GCs is extended, and not point-like, as 
                                        expected in the case of an IMBH. This points to the presence of an 
                                        inner sub-cluster of faint compact objects.</em></b>

										<h4><font size="+0">The role of core-collapse</font></h4>
										One of the most interesting phenomena related to GCs is the process 
										of core-collapse, which is intrinsically related to the exchange of
                                        energy due to dynamical interactions in the cluster. In self-gravitating
                                        systems like GCs, the virial theorem reveals that the centers of GCs
                                        have a negative heat capacity, i.e. an energy input in the system
                                        triggers a decrease of the kinetic energy, which can be regarded as
                                        the system’s ‘temperature’. Such a counterintuitive relation tends 
                                        to evolve in a typical cluster’s interior,
                                        as it exchanges energy with its outer regions, naturally from the
                                        former to the latter. This process leads inevitably to the ‘collapse’ of
                                        stars to the cluster’s inner-most regions. 
                                        
                                        <br><br>Many works argue that core-collapse can be halted due to
                                        a process called <em>binary burning</em>, where dynamical interactions 
                                        of binaries with other stars cause tight (‘hard’) binaries to harden while the
                                        third star (not necessarily the original one) is kicked out at a higher
                                        speed than the initial third star came in with. This
                                        process effectively pumps energy to the cluster’s inner regions, thus
                                        preventing core-collapse from continuing indefinitely.
                                                                                
										<br><br>Black holes in GCs form and sink early (on roughly 100 Myr time-scales)
                                        to the cluster’s center due to a combination of their high masses
                                        and energy equipartition. Once in the inner regions of GCs, black
                                        holes dynamically interact with one another and with luminous stars.
                                        Those living in hard binaries thus provide a similar energy exchange
                                        towards the cluster’s interior as in the classical stellar binary-burning
                                        scenario, but amplified due to the relative high masses of black holes
                                        compared to stars. This new theoretical comprehension of the physics governing
                                        GCs suggests that the ones without the characteristic inner cuspy
                                        structure of core-collapse probably harbour a segregated black hole
                                        population, responsible for the delay of core-collapse. This phenomenon has 
                                        been referred to as <em>black hole binary burning</em>.
